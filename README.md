# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains several machine learning projects, each designed to tackle different types of problems using various algorithms. Below is an overview of each project:

## Housing Price Prediction
### Linear Regression
This project uses linear regression to predict housing prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and floors. The model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score, and results are visualized to show the accuracy of predictions versus actual values.

## Customer Churn Prediction
### Logistic Regression
The goal of this project is to predict customer churn using logistic regression. The model is trained on customer data, including both categorical and numerical features, to classify whether a customer will return or churn. Performance is assessed using classification reports and confusion matrices, and feature importance is analyzed to understand the impact of different variables.

### Random Forest Classifier
This project extends the customer churn prediction using a Random Forest Classifier. It involves preprocessing the data, training the model, and evaluating its performance. Additionally, feature importance is examined to highlight which features contribute most to the prediction.

## Customer Segmentation
### K-Means Clustering
This project performs customer segmentation using K-Means clustering. The goal is to group customers into distinct clusters based on features such as age, annual income, and spending score. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the elbow method, and clusters are visualized in a 3D plot to analyze customer segments.

## Loan Approval Prediction
### Decision Tree
In this project, a decision tree classifier is used to predict loan approval based on features like income, age, employment years, debt, and credit score. The model's performance is evaluated with accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports. Additionally, the decision tree is visualized to understand the decision-making process and feature importance.

## Image Classification
### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
This project focuses on image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is trained to classify images into 10 different categories. The project's output includes evaluation metrics such as test accuracy, as well as visualizations of training and validation accuracy and loss. Predictions on test images are also displayed to show the CNN's performance.
